#### [News App](https://github.com/sayemimtiaz/newsapp){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

This is a simple web application based on the Java Spring Boot framework for creating news stories and accessing them in different data formats for consumption. I developed this web application as part of an assessment for a Java Developer position at [Cefalo](https://www.cefalo.com/en/) in 2016, which led to a job offer from them. The application uses an [in-memory SQL database](https://hsqldb.org/) for persisting data and [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) for rendering the HTML. The application has been developed using an [MVC architectural pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller), promoting a loosely coupled design of the different components, making it scalable and easily maintainable. This application can serve as a good starting point for aspiring full-stack web developers aiming to leverage an MVC architecture and the Java ecosystem.

#### [News App Again](https://github.com/sayemimtiaz/NewsApp-with-Angular-MongoDB){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

This is the *News App* redone using a different technology stack as a [single-page application (SPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application). It uses a [NoSQL database](https://www.mongodb.com/) instead of an SQL one for its persistence system. The front end is built with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) to render the view and design it as a SPA. Additionally, it automates both back-end and front-end dependency management using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and [Bower](https://bower.io/).
