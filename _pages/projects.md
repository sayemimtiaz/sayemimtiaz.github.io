#### [News App](https://github.com/sayemimtiaz/newsapp){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

This is a simple web application based on the Java Spring Boot framework for creating news stories and accessing them in different data formats for consumption. I developed this web application as part of an assessment for a Java Developer position at [Cefalo](https://www.cefalo.com/en/) in 2016, which led to a job offer from them. The application uses an [in-memory SQL database](https://hsqldb.org/) for persisting data and [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) for rendering the HTML. The application has been developed using an [MVC architectural pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller), promoting a loosely coupled design of the different components, making it scalable and easily maintainable. This application can serve as a good starting point for aspiring full-stack web developers aiming to leverage an MVC architecture and the Java ecosystem.
