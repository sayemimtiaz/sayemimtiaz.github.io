## Research
Broadly, my research interest spans three domains of computer science and engineering:
### Software engineering
The software has become omnipresent, permeating all aspects of our lives and influencing both routine and critical tasks. Whether it's tracking steps or assisting in complex medical procedures, software plays a vital role. Given our heavy reliance on software, the importance of efficient software engineering (SE) cannot be overstated. SE focuses on delivering techniques and methodologies that enable the development, evolution, and maintenance of software in a superior manner. It seeks to ensure the safety, robustness, and transparency of the software that people rely on so heavily. As an SE researcher, I primarily study the modularity and security aspects of the software. Modularity enables flexible, maintainable software development through reusable components, while security focuses on protecting against vulnerabilities and threats.
### AI engineering
The current era is defined by a transformative revolution driven by artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning. This has led to a redefinition of the software landscape with the widespread integration of AI components. Consequently, modern software exhibits a more probabilistic nature, displaying distinct behaviors compared to traditional software. This fundamental shift in software demands renewed focus from researchers in the field of software engineering (SE). As an SE researcher, my primary focus revolves around studying the evolvability and modularity of deep learning (DL), a class of machine learning algorithms that has gained significant attention in recent times.
### Deep learning
Deep learning (DL) algorithms, with their ability to learn from large datasets, have gained significant attention for their effectiveness in academia and industry. Similar to the transformative impact of the telephone, DL is revolutionizing various aspects of people's lives, enabling automation in diverse fields, including engineering. This has sparked immense interest among researchers, myself included, in exploring the potential and challenges of DL. Personally, I am particularly passionate about studying the transfer and incremental learning of DL models, aiming to advance their capabilities and applications.
