Meet my avatars â€“ reflections of the different me's that brought me here.

#### Sayem as a Researcher

I am currently pursuing my PhD in the <a href="https://www.cs.iastate.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/) under the guidance of [Dr. Hridesh Rajan](https://hridesh.github.io/) in the <a href="https://design.cs.iastate.edu/">Laboratory for Software Design</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of software engineering and machine learning, with a focus on facilitating efficient engineering for AI systems, a field often referred to as *AI Engineering*. My PhD research has explored various aspects of deep learning models, including their decomposability, code quality, API contracts, and more. I particularly emphasize the benefits of modularity in the context of deep learning, especially for NLP models. Additionally, I investigate methods to mitigate data-driven errors in large language models through targeted strategies.


Prior to joining Iowa State, I obtained my master's degree in computer science from <a href="https://www.cse.msstate.edu/">Mississippi State University</a>, which provided me with valuable research opportunities. During my time there, I actively contributed to the field of software engineering, focusing specifically on promoting secure software development. My research efforts resulted in several publications that have advanced the understanding and practices in this area. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to engage in interdisciplinary collaboration between transportation engineering and computer science, working alongside <a href="https://www.uta.edu/academics/faculty/profile?username=lip">Dr. Pengfei Li</a>. Together, we proposed a novel analysis tool for examining traffic signal coordination, bridging the gap between these two domains.



My journey in computer science began with a bachelor's degree from <a href="https://www.cuet.ac.bd/">Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology</a>, where I worked under the guidance of <a href="https://www.cuet.ac.bd/members/498">Dr. Koushik Deb</a>. My undergraduate thesis concentrated on the development of a robust automated video surveillance system. The objective was to create a system capable of adapting to various real-world scenarios, significantly reducing object tracking time.

#### Sayem as a Software Developer

Before embarking on my journey for higher education in the United States in 2017, I spent nearly four years working as a professional software developer. During this time, I was involved in a diverse array of projects, ranging from C-based communication servers to full-stack web development and C#-based biometric software development.

My professional journey began with a role as a software engineer at [Eyeball Networks](https://www.facebook.com/EyeballNetworks/), a VoIP solution provider based in Canada. There, I served as a developer for an [XMPP-based](https://xmpp.org/) [Eyeball Instant Messaging (IM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeball_Chat) server. Among my contributions were the implementation of key features such as XMPP's [publish-subscribe protocol](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html) and a caching mechanism.

Subsequently, I transitioned to [TigerIT Bangladesh Ltd.](https://www.tigerit.com/), a leading Bangladeshi identity solution provider, in 2014. During my tenure of over three years at TigerIT, I served as a full-stack engineer. I was involved in various projects, including the development of a biometric-based identity solution for the Nepal government, a web-based solution for maintaining an efficient prison inmate database system, and fingerprint enrollment and identification systems for the Bhutan government and Bangladesh immigration, among others.
