#### Research Agenda
I am currently focusing on software engineering for AI and ML systems. Specifically, I am working to promote modularity in deep learning that offers many benefits, such as efficient reengineering of large models, modular reasoning and verification, etc.

#### Short Biography
I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the <a href="https://www.cs.iastate.edu/">Department of Computer Science at Iowa State University</a>, where I am a fourth-year student. I am currently a member of the <a href="https://design.cs.iastate.edu/">Laboratory for Software Design</a>, where I work under the guidance and supervision of Dr. Hridesh Rajan.

Prior to joining Iowa State, I obtained my master's degree in computer science from <a href="https://www.cse.msstate.edu/">Mississippi State University</a>, which provided me with valuable research opportunities. During my time there, I actively contributed to the field of software engineering, focusing specifically on promoting secure software development. My research efforts resulted in several publications that have advanced the understanding and practices in this area. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to engage in interdisciplinary collaboration between transportation engineering and computer science, working alongside <a href="https://www.uta.edu/academics/faculty/profile?username=lip">Dr. Pengfei Li</a>. Together, we proposed a novel analysis tool for examining traffic signal coordination, bridging the gap between these two domains.



My journey in computer science began with a bachelor's degree from <a href="https://www.cuet.ac.bd/">Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology</a>, where I worked under the guidance of <a href="https://www.cuet.ac.bd/members/498">Dr. Koushik Deb</a>. My undergraduate thesis concentrated on the development of a robust automated video surveillance system. The objective was to create a system capable of adapting to various real-world scenarios, significantly reducing object tracking time.
